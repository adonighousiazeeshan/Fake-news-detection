Fake News Detection using TF-IDF Vectorization and Passive Aggressive Classifier

Description:
In this project, we implement a fake news detection system using a combination of TF-IDF vectorization and the Passive Aggressive Classifier algorithm. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization is utilized to convert text data into numerical vectors, capturing the importance of each word in distinguishing between fake and real news articles. The Passive Aggressive Classifier is then employed as a supervised learning algorithm to classify news articles based on these TF-IDF vectors.

Implementation Steps:

Initialize TF-IDF Vectorizer:
We begin by initializing a TF-IDF Vectorizer object with specific parameters. In this case, we set stop_words to 'english' to remove common English words that may not carry significant meaning, and max_df to 0.7 to ignore terms that have a document frequency higher than 70%.

Fit and Transform Train Set, Transform Test Set:
Next, we fit and transform the training set (x_train) using the TF-IDF Vectorizer, converting the text data into TF-IDF vectors. Similarly, we transform the test set (x_test) using the same vectorizer to ensure consistency in feature representation.

Initialize Passive Aggressive Classifier:
We then initialize a Passive Aggressive Classifier object, setting max_iter to 50 to limit the number of iterations during model training. The Passive Aggressive Classifier is a type of online learning algorithm suitable for large-scale text classification tasks.

Fit the Classifier:
We fit the Passive Aggressive Classifier on the TF-IDF transformed training data (tfidf_train) along with the corresponding target labels (y_train).

Predict on Test Set and Calculate Accuracy:
After training the classifier, we make predictions on the TF-IDF transformed test data (tfidf_test) using the predict method of the classifier. We then calculate the accuracy of the model by comparing the predicted labels (y_pred) with the actual labels (y_test) using the accuracy_score function.

Conclusion:
By leveraging TF-IDF vectorization and the Passive Aggressive Classifier, we have developed an effective fake news detection system capable of accurately classifying news articles as fake or real. This approach demonstrates the power of combining feature engineering techniques with supervised learning algorithms to address real-world challenges such as identifying misinformation in news media.
